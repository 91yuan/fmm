FMM is an open source map matching framework designed for maximizing performance, scalability and functionality. 

### Why should I use FMM?

- High performance: C++ implementation with Rtree for spatial search, optimized routing, parallel computing. 
- Python API supported: run map matching in jupyter-notebook and web demo
- Scalibility: it has been tested on matching **millions of GPS points** to **country level** road network containing **millions of road edges**.  
- Multiple input data format support: 
  - Road network: ESRI shapefile or Geopackageï¼ŒOSM can also be supported with [manual preprocessing](https://github.com/cyang-kth/osm_mapmatching). 
  - GPS: CSV point, CSV Trajectory or Shapefile trajectory.
- Customized output format: road edge matched to each point, observation error, distance traveled. 
- Multiple map matching algorithms implemented: 
  - FMM: suitable for small road network and dense GPS data
  - STMatch: suitable for large road network with sparse GPS data
- Cross platform support: Unix, Mac and Windows.  

We encourage contribution with feature request, bug report or developping new map matching algorithms using the framework.

FMM originates from an implementation of this paper [Fast map matching, an algorithm integrating hidden Markov model with precomputation](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2017.1400548). A post-print version of the paper can be downloaded at [link](https://people.kth.se/~cyang/bib/fmm.pdf). Substaintial new features have been added compared with the original paper.
